# Persian Handwritten Digit Generation using Conditional GANs

#### Overview:
This project focuses on the development and implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate realistic Persian handwritten digits. Leveraging the power of GANs and conditioning techniques, the project aims to synthesize high-quality images that mimic the style and complexity of human-written Persian numerals. This initiative addresses the need for diverse datasets in the field of computer vision, particularly for languages and scripts less represented in the digital domain.

#### Objectives:
- **Model Development**: Design and train a CGAN model capable of generating images of Persian handwritten digits conditioned on specific numeral inputs.
- **Data Augmentation**: Provide a method for augmenting existing datasets with synthetic images, enhancing the robustness of machine learning models trained on Persian handwritten recognition tasks.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the quality and diversity of generated digits using standard metrics and compare them with real handwritten samples.

#### Technical Highlights:
- **CGAN Architecture**: Customized the CGAN framework to conditionally generate images based on input digit labels, ensuring the output closely matches the desired numeral.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Utilized a comprehensive dataset of Persian handwritten digits, applying preprocessing steps to normalize the images and facilitate effective model training.
- **Model Training and Optimization**: Employed advanced optimization techniques and hyperparameter tuning to improve model stability and image quality.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Adopted FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) and qualitative assessments by domain experts to measure the realism and diversity of the generated images.

#### Achievements:
- Successfully generated high-quality, diverse images of Persian handwritten digits that are indistinguishable from authentic handwriting samples to the unaided eye.
- Demonstrated the potential of CGANs in enhancing dataset diversity for underrepresented scripts, contributing to more inclusive and robust machine learning models.
- Shared insights and best practices for CGAN implementation and training, offering valuable resources to the AI and computer vision communities.

#### Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras for model development and training.
- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization and result analysis.

#### Future Work:
- Explore the application of this CGAN model to other scripts and languages, particularly those lacking extensive digital datasets.
- Investigate the integration of this technology into real-world applications, such as automated form processing and handwriting verification systems.
